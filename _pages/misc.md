I believe a healthy work-life balance is essential for staying creative üí° and motivated ‚ú®. The hobbies and interests
listed here are not just pastimes; they are vital parts of my life that help me recharge, think differently, and connect
with others.

### üéπ Piano

I regularly practice the piano, finding it a great way to unwind and express creativity. My repertoire mainly consists
of:

- **Classical Music:** I enjoy the complexity and emotional depth of classical pieces.
- **Game Soundtracks:** As a gamer, I also love learning and playing theme music from my favorite video games.

### üè∏ Badminton

I am an avid badminton player and play frequently to stay active.

- My skill level is around Level 4 (BadmintonCN rating system), which is considered an intermediate to advanced
  amateur level.

### üéÆ Gaming

I'm a passionate gamer and enjoy a wide variety of formats, from immersive single-player experiences to competitive and
social games.

- **Console Gaming:** I'm a Nintendo fan, having spent hours exploring the worlds of games like *The Legend of Zelda*
  series and enjoying the creative platforming of the *Super Mario* franchise. I also love challenging and acclaimed
  indie titles such as *Hollow Knight* and *Celeste*.

- **Esports:** I also enjoy the strategic challenge of competitive shooters.
    - **Overwatch:** I previously reached the **Master** rank and am proficient with a versatile hero pool, including
      tanks like Winston, D.Va, Wrecking Ball, and Reinhardt; damage heroes like Torbj√∂rn and Symmetra; and supports
      like Ana and Brigitte.
    - **Valorant:** I'm currently approaching the **Ascendant** tier. My strengths lie in
      playing controller agents (smokes), initiators (recon), and sentinels. I focus on map control, understanding
      default setups, and strategic decision-making.

- **Board Games:** When I'm not gaming on a screen, I enjoy the strategic and social dynamics of board games. I'm
  particularly fond of social deduction games like *The Resistance: Avalon* and *Blood on the Clocktower*.
