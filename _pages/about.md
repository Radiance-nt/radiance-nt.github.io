## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a Master's student in AI and Robotics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ), with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Xi'an Jiaotong University.
My primary research interest is in developing intelligent agents capable of robust decision-making. To achieve this, I draw upon my expertise across Robotics, Machine Learning, and Computer Science. While my core focus is on Reinforcement Learning, I also keep pace with recent advancements in generative AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion/Flow Models. My approach is grounded in strong computer science fundamentals and practical engineering skills, enabling me to build efficient and reliable real-world systems.

**Robust Self-Training with Closed-loop Label Correction for Learning from Noisy Labels** <u>Zhanhui Lin</u>, Yanlin Liu, Sanping Zhou.  
[[PDF]]( /files/Robust_Self_Training_with_Closed_loop_Label_Correction_for_Learning_from_Noisy_Labels.pdf)

- Introduced an efficient, stable, and scalable framework** for training deep neural networks on datasets with noisy labels. Our method effectively mitigates performance degradation caused by label noise.

  * Proposed a novel purification paradigm where a lightweight correction network (2-layer MLP), guided by a small set of clean data, dynamically refines the labels of a large-scale noisy dataset to supervise the main classifier.

  * Designed a robust correction mechanism that balances high expressiveness with theoretical stability. Our approach is guaranteed to be risk-non-increasing, which effectively prevents error amplification and model collapse during training.

  * Achieved state-of-the-art performance while requiring substantially less training time and computational resources than existing methods.
